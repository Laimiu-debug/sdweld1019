# Quota Check Changes Summary

## Overview
Modified the quota check system to skip quota validation for physical asset modules in personal workspaces while maintaining quota checks for document modules in all workspace types.

## Problem Statement
The system was performing quota checks on all modules when creating resources in personal workspaces, causing 500 Internal Server Errors when creating equipment in personal workspaces.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Quota Service (`backend/app/services/quota_service.py`)

#### Added New Quota Type Constants
```python
class QuotaType:
    # 文档类模块 - 所有工作区都需要检查配额
    WPS = "wps"
    PQR = "pqr"
    PPQR = "ppqr"
    
    # 物理资产类模块 - 个人工作区不检查配额
    EQUIPMENT = "equipment"
    MATERIALS = "materials"
    WELDERS = "welders"
    PRODUCTION = "production"
    QUALITY = "quality"
    
    # 其他配额类型
    STORAGE = "storage"
    EMPLOYEES = "employees"
    FACTORIES = "factories"
```

#### Updated `check_quota()` Method
- Added logic to skip quota checks for physical asset modules in personal workspaces
- Physical asset modules: Equipment, Materials, Welders, Production, Quality
- Document modules (WPS, PQR, pPQR) continue to have quota checks in all workspace types

```python
def check_quota(self, user, workspace_context, quota_type, increment=1):
    # 定义物理资产类模块（个人工作区不检查配额）
    physical_asset_modules = {
        QuotaType.EQUIPMENT,
        QuotaType.MATERIALS,
        QuotaType.WELDERS,
        QuotaType.PRODUCTION,
        QuotaType.QUALITY
    }
    
    # 个人工作区：物理资产类模块跳过配额检查
    if workspace_context.is_personal() and quota_type in physical_asset_modules:
        return True
    
    # 其他情况：正常检查配额
    ...
```

#### Updated `increment_quota_usage()` Method
- Added logic to skip quota usage tracking for physical asset modules in personal workspaces
- Prevents unnecessary database updates for modules that don't have quota limits

#### Updated `decrement_quota_usage()` Method
- Added logic to skip quota usage tracking for physical asset modules in personal workspaces
- Ensures consistency when deleting resources

#### Updated Enterprise Quota Mappings
- Added mappings for new module types in enterprise quota checks
- Ensures enterprise workspaces can still enforce quotas on all modules

### 2. Re-enabled Quota Checks in Equipment Service (`backend/app/services/equipment_service.py`)

#### Updated `create_equipment()` Method
```python
# Before (commented out):
# if not self.quota_service.check_quota(current_user, workspace_context, "equipment", 1):
#     raise Exception("设备配额不足")

# After (re-enabled):
self.quota_service.check_quota(current_user, workspace_context, "equipment", 1)
```

The quota check now works correctly because:
- Personal workspaces: Check returns `True` immediately (no quota limit)
- Enterprise workspaces: Check validates against company quota limits

## Quota Logic Summary

### For Users NOT in an Enterprise (Personal Workspace Only)
- **Physical Assets** (Equipment, Materials, Welders, Production, Quality): **No quota checks**
- **Documents** (WPS, PQR, pPQR): Quota follows individual membership tier
- **Storage**: Quota follows individual membership tier

### For Users in an Enterprise

#### Enterprise Workspace
- **All Modules**: Based on enterprise membership tier, shared among all employees
- **Physical Assets**: Quota enforced based on company limits
- **Documents**: Quota enforced based on company limits

#### Personal Workspace
- **Physical Assets**: **No quota checks** (same as non-enterprise users)
- **Documents**: 
  - Paid account (enterprise owner): Individual Premium tier quota
  - Unpaid employee accounts: Individual Professional tier quota

## Frontend Integration

### Workspace Switching
The existing frontend implementation already handles workspace switching properly:

1. **MembershipContext** (`frontend/src/contexts/MembershipContext.tsx`)
   - Listens for `workspace-switched` events
   - Updates membership tier and quota information when workspace changes
   - Stores updated information in localStorage

2. **WorkspaceSwitcher** (`frontend/src/components/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx`)
   - Triggers `workspace-switched` event when user switches workspaces
   - Causes page reload to ensure all components reflect new workspace context

3. **Automatic Updates**
   - Membership tier display updates immediately on workspace switch
   - Quota information refreshes to show current workspace limits
   - All quota-related UI components receive updated context

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
1. Test equipment creation in personal workspace (should succeed without quota check)
2. Test equipment creation in enterprise workspace (should check quota)
3. Test WPS/PQR/pPQR creation in personal workspace (should check quota)
4. Test WPS/PQR/pPQR creation in enterprise workspace (should check quota)
5. Test quota usage tracking for document modules
6. Verify quota usage is NOT tracked for physical assets in personal workspaces

### Frontend Testing
1. Switch from personal to enterprise workspace
   - Verify membership tier updates in UI
   - Verify quota information updates
2. Switch from enterprise to personal workspace
   - Verify membership tier updates in UI
   - Verify quota information updates
3. Create equipment in personal workspace
   - Should succeed without quota errors
4. Create WPS/PQR in personal workspace
   - Should respect quota limits

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/services/quota_service.py`
   - Added new quota type constants
   - Updated `check_quota()` method
   - Updated `increment_quota_usage()` method
   - Updated `decrement_quota_usage()` method
   - Updated enterprise quota mappings

2. `backend/app/services/equipment_service.py`
   - Re-enabled quota check in `create_equipment()` method

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

1. `frontend/src/contexts/MembershipContext.tsx` - Already handles workspace switching
2. `frontend/src/components/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx` - Already triggers membership updates
3. `backend/app/services/equipment_service.py` - Already handles quota usage updates on create/delete

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Personal workspace users can create physical assets without quota restrictions
2. **Logical Quota Management**: Document modules maintain quota checks as they can accumulate in large numbers
3. **Enterprise Control**: Enterprise workspaces maintain full quota control over all modules
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Frontend automatically updates to reflect current workspace quota context
5. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates 500 errors when creating equipment in personal workspaces

## Notes

- The changes are backward compatible with existing data
- No database migrations required
- The logic is centralized in `QuotaService` for easy maintenance
- Frontend workspace switching was already implemented correctly and requires no changes
